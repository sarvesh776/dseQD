+*TO BE DONE*+ # After selecting the contest from the dropdown, it is unclear to the moderator what is the status of the report. We should show the status immediately after selecting the contest as one of the following. ## Plagiarism Report has not been created ## Plagiarism Report is being created ## Plagiarism Report create # If Plagiarism Report has been created but no plagiarism found, the report should have the message "Report created. No Plagiarism was found". # The code compare URL is broken. It has to be manually updated to https every time. ## We should fix it for all future reports ## Run a script for old reports ( low priority) # [Bug] If we search for X%, and no such match exists; it shows us the correct message. After updating the text field it is showing "No result found" # [feature] code compare click - grey out to indicate that it has been checked already # Plagiarism generation is taking a lot of time. (Not sure if this can be optimized) +*ON-HOLD*+ # Some moderators have reported that the match percentage is different on the "plagiarism report" and "code compare" pages. I have not been able to reproduce this yet. +*COMPLETED*+ # -To deduct individual scores, currently, we have to fill in a value in the "deduct score" field. Please remove this limitation.- # -[URGENT BUG] If we select a problem and then use the deduct all button, it deducts the score for ALL problems.-
